## Overview

Neural style transfer is a technique that applies the artistic style of one image to another. This project utilizes TensorFlow Hub for style transfer and integrates it with Gradio for the user interface and Flask for the backend.

## Features

- Neural Style Transfer: Apply the artistic style of one image to another.
- User Interaction: Use Gradio for a user-friendly interface to upload images.
- Backend Server: Utilize Flask to handle image uploads and serve the stylized results.
- Customizable: Easily extend or modify the code for your specific needs.
